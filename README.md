 Weather Forecasting App

In this project, I developed a weather forecasting app using React Native. The primary objective was to create a user-friendly interface that fetches weather data from a RESTful API and presents it in an organized manner.

Key Features:

User Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive UI, displaying current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. The interface is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

API Integration: I implemented a module to handle API requests efficiently. This module fetches weather data from the API and parses it into a format suitable for display in the app.

Data Presentation: Weather data is presented in a clear and concise manner, with the current temperature prominently displayed and the 5-day forecast neatly organized. Users can quickly glance at the app to get essential weather information for planning their activities.

Technical Details:

The app is built using React Native, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications.
API requests are made using the built-in fetch function, and data is fetched asynchronously to ensure smooth performance.
The UI components are styled using the StyleSheet API provided by React Native, allowing for consistent styling across different devices.
Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the API request process.
Outcome:

This weather forecasting app serves as a demonstration of my skills in app development, including UI design, API integration, and data presentation. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in building mobile applications and honed my ability to create engaging user experiences.
